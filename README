3. Thats It. You've Successfully Installed the Yii Rackspace Connect Extension. Now to move to examples.
* You will want to insert your rackspace login and API key into the correct value where the uppercase login and key should be your info.


Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [mandatory] PHP version 5.x (developed against 5.2.0)
 [mandatory] PHP's cURL module
 [mandatory] PHP enabled with mbstring (multi-byte string) support
 [suggested] PEAR FileInfo module (for Content-Type detection)

Examples
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently there are 2 uses for this extension. You can add files to a Rackspace Cloud container and you can view them. We will need to add a method to delete files.

Uploading Files to Rackspace File Container
------------------------------------------
  Lets say you have a file upload form that you'd like to use to add the files to Rackspace.
  
  1. Go to your Controller's actionCreate method.
  2. Add the following code.
	
	 $model->file=CUploadedFile::getInstance($model,'file'); // 'file' is the name of file input field I have uploaded
					if($model->save()){
							if (isset($model->file)){
			$target_path = $model->file->getName();  // This sets the new file name as the one uploaded. You can change
							$model->file->saveAs($target_path);  // You MUST upload to your server first
							Yii::app()->rackspaceconnect->upload('teepopz2', $target_path); // Replace CONTAINER with your desired container
							}
							$this->redirect(array('view','id'=>$model->id));
					}
  
  3. Thats it.
  
  * Yii::app()->rackspaceconnect->upload($container, $file); //Function that uploads to Rackspace Container
  

Viewing and Retrieving Files from Container
-------------------------------------------

1. Add the following function into any view file.
	Yii::app()->rackspaceconnect->run($container);

* This grabs all the files inside of the container as an array. You will need a foreach, for or while loop to display them.

	/* Display as a list */
	$myContainer = Yii::app()->rackspaceconect->run($container); // Replace $container with desired container.. 'siteContainer'
	echo '<ul>';
	foreach ($myContainer as $file){
		echo '<li>'.$file.'</li>';
		}
	echo '</ul>';
	
	/* Grab a Single file */
	$myContainer = Yii::app()->rackspaceconnnect->run($container);
	$fileName = 'myFile.jpg';
	foreach ($myContainer as $file){
		if($file == $fileName) echo $file; // Echoes the filename. Doesn't display the file
		}
	// You can have several ways to grab single files. We will also want to write a new function to grab just a single file.
	
	/* Display all images */
	$myContainer = Yii::app()->rackspaceconnect->run($container);
	$containerUrl = 'http://containerurl' // Replace with your Container URL
	foreach($myContainer as $file){
		if(strripos($file, '.jpg') !== false)
			echo '<img src="'.$containerUrl.'/'.$file.'" alt="'.$file.'" />';
			}
	// Note that this simply retrieves and displays the images. You'll want to play with the formatting and how you want to view the images.
	
	
TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a very solid and good start to a Rackspace cloud file extension but it definitely can be developed more. Here are some of my thoughts.

1. Method to delete files.
2. Method to call single files using arguments.
3. Improve updating method to check if file exist and possibly rename file.
